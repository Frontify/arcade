# Layout

A design principle in Arcade is that components should not provide surrounding empty space. Instead, the spaces between elements are controlled by the layout component. This helps to enable composition and have a systematic approach to spacing.

Currently the following layouts are available:

-   [**Stack**](?path=/story/components-stack--default): A layout that arranges elements either vertically or horizontally.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-stack--default" />
</Canvas>
