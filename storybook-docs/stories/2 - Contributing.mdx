# Contributing to Fondue

## Installation

1. Clone the [Fondue repository](https://github.com/Frontify/fondue.git) to your local machine.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development

Run `pnpm storybook` to start the storybook development server.

Storybook will be available on [http://localhost:6010](http://localhost:6010).
This Storybook instance is configured and served from the `/storybook-docs` package which is caused to proxy and compose all other Storybook instances in the monorepo.

In the background, multiple instances of Storybook will start up, one for each component package in the monorepo.
 * Storybook for `@frontify/fondue-components` will be available on Port 6006
 * Storybook for `@frontify/fondue` will be available on Port 6008

You can also start the Storybook instances for the individual packages by running `pnpm storybook` in the respective package directory.

## Building Packages

The Packages in the Monorepo are built independently.
To build the packages, run `pnpm build` in the respective package directory.

Alternatively you can run the following scripts in the root directory.
- `pnpm build:components`
- `pnpm build:fondue`
- `pnpm build:icons`
- `pnpm build:charts`

## Releasing Packages

We utilize [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage our releases.

To bump the version of a Package, run `pnpm release` in the root directory and follow the prompts to select your package and version bump.
A file containg your release notes will be created in the `.changeset` directory.

After your change is merged to the `main` branch, the change will automatically be added to a release PR.
Once we merge the release PR, the package will be published to NPM.
