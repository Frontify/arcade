# Getting Started

Welcome to Fondue, The Design System for the [Frontify](https://frontify.com) ecosystem.

## Installation

Add the Fondue Design System Package as a dependency to your project. ```pnpm i @frontify/fondue```

## Finding Components

You can browse all available components in the Storybook instance for the [Fondue Design System](https://fondue-components.frontify.com).
This Storybook contains all Components from all subpackages in the Fondue Monorepo. Each Component will have a Badge in the Top Bar indicating it's current lifecycele state.

For the designers, the documentation is available in the [Fondue Design System Documentation](https://weare.frontify.com/document/1266?#/using-fondue) on weare.
## Usage
During the transition period in which we are cleaning up the Fondue Components, you can use old and new components side by side.

### Was this component already refactored?

If a component was refactored, the old implementation will be marked as __deprecated__.

This will be visible in the code when you consume the Component and through a Badge in the Top Bar of the Storybook Story.

### Using Refactored Components

If you want to use a refactored component, you can already import them through the `/components` subexport in the fondue package.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@frontify/fondue/components';

const App = () => (
    <Button>Click Me</Button>
);
```

### Using Old Components

If you are using the old components, you can continue to import them directly from the `@frontify/fondue` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@frontify/fondue';

const App = () => (
    <Button>Click Me</Button>
);
```
